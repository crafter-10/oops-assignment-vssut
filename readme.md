here we solve assignment questions collabarately.
all the inovative ideas and errors will be discussed.

FILE NOTATION : a13.cpp means answer of question no 13.


and a14.txt means the user inputs required to run the program , you just have to copy the content of a14.txt and paste in the terminal, while a14.cpp asks for input (it asks for a large number of input, so .txt file holds the sample input for that code)


contribution of new answers will be appreciatable :)
